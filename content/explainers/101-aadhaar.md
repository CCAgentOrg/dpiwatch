## Citizen Rights Analysis

### Privacy Implications
- Aadhaar stores biometric data (fingerprints, iris) - unique to each individual
- Biometric data is irretrievable if compromised
- Every authentication creates a trail linking identity to service usage

### Data Protection Concerns
- **Centralized Database**: Single point of failure for 1.4 billion identities
- **Data Breaches**: Past incidents showed vulnerabilities
- **Function Creep**: Use beyond original identity verification purpose

### Digital Inclusion Issues
- **Authentication Failures**: Elderly, manual workers with worn fingerprints excluded
- **Offline Limitations**: Many services mandate online Aadhaar verification
- **Exclusion Risk**: Those without Aadhaar denied essential services

### User Risks
- **Identity Theft**: Biometric data theft is irreversible
- **Surveillance**: Authentication logs enable tracking of citizen movements
- **Service Denial**: Technical failures block access to benefits, banking

### Safeguards
- Use mask Aadhaar (show last 4 digits) wherever possible
- Enable notification alerts for authentications
- Report unauthorized usage to UIDAI

### Complaints & Grievance Redressal
- **UIDAI**: uidai.gov.in/en/contact-us
- **Aadhaar Seva Kendra**: For enrollment issues
- **Consumer Courts**: For service denial due to Aadhaar
- **RTI**: Request authentication logs
